I am a technician specializing in pbc micro-soldering in electronics, passionate about the operation of each electronic device and curious to know the why of things.
And yes, of course, I am very attracted to programming.

I love Python.

My first contact, so to speak, with the world of programming was using Notepad (typical of the Windows OS) writing the typical msgbox "hello" or simply making jokes in the VBS code.
Later I discovered GameMaker (a game creation program, at that time it was in the midst of launching 8.0) and I learned a little about the GML language and became much more curious about how games work.

I learned to use tools to alter scores in games, and cheats within them at the HEX and Binary level.
To decipher and reverse engineer programs to discover their base code.

I learned at 12 years old to decipher an APK and take language without having much knowledge to be able to modify the internal files and mold them in my own way, removing privileges and so on, and even altering Samsung software for those times.
I learned to use a lot of PC programs, from design, music editing, video editing, 3D modeling such as Blender, small Unity projects (I deleted a unit that had physics and it was damaged, I couldn't save anything .)

When I was 14 years old I set up a game server called "Tales of Pirates". I remember using a Hamachi server, and I edited its .Lua files to make powers and weapons.
Some time later I was interested in another game called Tibia, which also had the same Lua language.
Nowadays I find myself striving daily to learn, I learn something new every day, whether in my personal or work part.
I learned the essential English for basic communications when I was 13 years old, I played a game made in Java with a multiplayer connection on a mobile phone and I learned to use it in writing to communicate with people.

I am taking a Course to have an ABA English College certificate for be best.
